# Final Project Proposal
# 
# Data Science Project -Predicting survival on the Titanic
#     Main Goal:  Create a model to predict survival on the Titanic.
#     Motivation: I have been very interested in the titanic tragedy since I watched the James Cameron movie as a young boy.
#                 Also, it seems interesting how the movie basically outlines the survival rate was largely derived by wealth.
#                 I would like to investigate this using my newly acquired R knowledge.

# Your project has a recognizable "data science workflow," such as the OSEMN workflow or Hadley Wickham's Grammar
# of Data Science. [Example: First the data is acquired, then necessary transformations and clean-up are performed, then
#                   the analysis and presentation work is performed]
