This unstructured data describes the behavior of the many real-world entities such as companies, products, and ports, that make up international trade in goods across borders. Our technology and expertise allow us to extract and link these entities from our database of billions of individual records. This data feeds the Panjiva platform, through which we provide powerful search, analysis, and visualization capabilities to our customers. Panjiva's data helps power the decisions of our thousands of clients, including Fortune 500 companies, hedge funds, and logistics providers, in addition to universities, government agencies, and NGOs. The Data Science team builds tools and models that enable the Panjiva platform. Our data scientists work with highly complex, often unstructured, multidimensional data from dozens of countries in many different languages. We use NLP, clustering, classification, regressions and a host of other algorithms / ML tools to curate and extract insight from our data. All of this work directly feeds our site, giving our customers the tools they need to answer their toughest questions. Data Science is core to the value Panjiva provides our customers. As an example, we built a custom text classification model that better handles rare terms (think Aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly), multiple languages, and misspellings that traditional language embedding techniques struggle with. This model allows our customers to search our data by industry standard product categories, rather than relying on text-based searches. We are seeking talented data scientists to join our team.
